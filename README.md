# BukkitPlugins

## What is this?
A repository containing all of my bukkit plugins


## Why?
Because it was too big of a hassle to upload every source code to a new repository.

## Am I allowed to use them?
Since this is licensed under 'CC0 1.0 Universal' you can use, edit and publish all of the plugins by yourself.
This is not necessary, but I would love if you were to leave my name somewhere in your project :)
